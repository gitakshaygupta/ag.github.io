            <h2>Akshay's Story</h2>

            <p class="para">Born and raised in India, Akshay, 24, comes from a middle class family in the sacred city of Haridwar. 
               He grew up to be a bright science student and decided to pursue Aerospace engineering after school. 
               As he completed first year of engineering with distinction at Amity University, he was presented with an opportunity to study 
               abroad for two years as part of a dual degree program with Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics in China.

                  <br><br>Two years passed with a snap of fingers, Akshay was now fluent in Chinese and had hundreds of friends.
		    He achieved great heights in academics and was awarded scholarship 
                  based on merit. Akshay 
                  participated in various Model United Nations conferences across China and developed himself into a ‘4 times Best Delegate’ 
                  public speaker. He also took on the International Student Association of the University where he headed the activities department. 
                  His graduate thesis work focused on Design and Aeroelastic flutter analysis of a Solar Wing Structure. Although this work was 
                  extremely challenging for a student who started engineering just 3 years ago, Akshay completed it with distinction and was 
                  recognized as the ‘Most Special Student of the Year.’

                  <br><br>Year 2016, Akshay presented his new
                   thesis in India where he build upon the previous thesis but this time from the aerodynamic side i.e. to study the flow along and 
                   across the solar wing at critical flutter speed. He was awarded the ‘Best Major Project Award’ for this thesis.

                   <br><br>Year 2017, Akshay took a big decision to go to France to pursue his Masters in Aerospace Engineering at ISAE-SUPAERO in 
                  Toulouse. Within a matter of months, he was accepted at ISAE-SUPAERO and the French government offered a highly sought 
                  after scholarship to him that covered all his tuition fees as well as expenses for the upcoming two years. 

                  <br><br>September 2017, Akshay lands for the first time out of Asia into a dreamland. He recalls seeing the first thing after 
                  touchdown, and that was the Airbus shelters at Blagnac airport. Master studies takes off and he gets busy with learning.
                   Not only engineering but also the French way of living and the European way of working. He served as the President of 
                   International Association of ISAE-SUPAERO for one year. Akshay was determined to improve the international image of the campus and brought several paradigm shifting changes during this one year.

                   <br><br>On the academic side, Akshay excelled in multi-disciplinary optimization as he did research on blended wing body aircraft with 
		    Dr. Joseph Morlier. This work earned him recognition in the scientific community at ISAE-SUPAERO. For his Masters
                   internship, Akshay was fortunate to get a couple of offers at Airbus in Toulouse in his domain of expertise but also an
                    offer in Airbus in Spain for working at Airbus ProtoSpace for 12 months under the Airbus Minds Program. The program that
		    is only for few interns and involves studying a Master degree in Decision Making and Innovation as well as Soft skills courses in a Business School in Madrid.

                    <br><br>March 2019, Akshay landed in Madrid, Spain to open his account at Airbus. Day 1 at ProtoSpace, he meets his manager who puts him at ease and show around ProtoSpace and the activities they do. Akshay was excited to start working 
                  and make this reality into an experience. Living in a new country and learning once again a new language is such a bonus for him.

                  <br><br>For one year, Akshay worked on several projects at the same time, out of which two projects he was leading. He worked in structural morphing project with MIT, USA and printed electronics with Airbus Hamburg. He worked on a robotics project of ADS for A400M. 
		    An area of work that he never thought he will work in. The Minds program developed him into a professional that the Next Chapter of Airbus wanted to have in the company. With breakfast meetings with experts and HOs in the company, Akshay 
		    had a chance to learn from vast experiences. The program also developed qualities, like emotional intelligence, decision-making, and teamwork with classes at EOI in Madrid. 
		    Akshay worked as a shopfloor technician in the production lines of A350 Section 19, A350 HTP, A330 HTP, Beluga XL HTP, A320 HTP, as it was a part of the program, so that engineers like Akshay can understand how their engineering design is put into manufacturing and what are the things 
                  that they need to take care of to make the life of production line workers easier.

                  
                  <br><br>Akshay is a very strong kind when it comes to fighting the face of adversity. He knows that with a crisis comes an opportunity to do things differently. Future is there but different from what we expected. 
		    He heard about the Airbus Humanity Lab Hackathon for presenting ideas and solution to fight with COVID-19. He joins it without a single thought. Within 48 hours, Akshay and his 
		    team proposed a solution for recycling the facemasks locally. Akshay designed a machine that could contain a number of masks and use UV-C technology to decontaminate the masks for second use. 

                  <br><br>The project was well appreciated by the Airbus HO Engineering, Mr. Jean Brice Dumont, as well as other sponsors of the Hackathon.
                   Just recently, Akshay has completed his contribution on the project and is now seeking new roles in Toulouse.

                   <br><br>Akshay’s journey so far has been a rewarding one. He has lived in four countries, met thousands of people who had some sort of inf
                  luence of him and can speak to almost 4.5 billion people in their native language.

                  <br><br>With that being said, Akshay hopes to continue this lifelong journey with milestones that enrich him!</p>

                        ▪ The aim of this work is to perform aeroelastic scaling on a Blended Wing Body (BWB) by making use of existing optimization-based design approach, and perform flutter optimization process thereafter.<br>
                        ▪ The objective function is chosen so as to maximize similarity of modal parameters (i.e. modal shapes and frequencies) between the scaled model and the reference model, by optimizing structural properties of the given test case. These structural properties are the design variables for the optimization schedules.<br>
                        ▪ The verification of mode shape similarity is performed with Modal Assurance Criterion (MAC).<br>
